# Intent of Study 
This project aims to study housing displacement occuring at  King County, WA through performing data analysis by focusing on pertinent variables. For this analyis, it focuses on Race as a the main variable. We intend to gain a deeper understanding of specific factors that may contribute to displacement by looking at the city-level statistics for King County. This data will be presented in the form of an interactive map, allowing the user to observe displacement trends across different races. Originally derived from the Deccenial Census Data, the data accounts for each race and is categorized inclusively. Our final deliverable will used to present to the council members to back Puget Soundâ€™s policies to combat gentrification. In doing so, we intend to offer a narrative for the evidence of displacement in King County.
